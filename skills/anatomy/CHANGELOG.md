# Changelog

All notable changes to Anatomy are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The skill has no version numbers yet, so entries are dated.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `examples/arcade-cabinet/`, an upright arcade cabinet with its side panel off. A quarter rolls down the coin chute past the coin-switch wire into the cash box, the switch's pulse runs along its cable to the board, and the CRT warms up, self-tests and runs an attract mode drawn in the plane of the tilted monitor; the stick closes a microswitch under the panel. It draws in the light and dark themes and passes `--audit`.
- `examples/spot-plate/`, a second React figure from the same site as `test-rig`: six pairs of glass drops that run together into one piece of glass as a fan of feeler blades sets `merge`. It draws in the light and dark themes.
- A first workflow step, **Size it before you start**: every request is sized as a Figure (about 30–90 minutes), a Hero (2–4 hours) or an Epic (6 hours or more), and the estimate is told to the user first. An Epic is not started until the user chooses it over a proposed Hero version. Every size has a working page within the first hour, and Claude reports when a step runs past twice its share of the estimate.

### Fixed

- `examples/test-rig/` drew its glass button dark in the light theme. `stretch.css` now has light values for its own colours.

### Changed

- The workflow steps are renumbered 1–10.
- The 4× detail sweep scales with the size: the subject and mechanism for a Figure, the whole drawing for a Hero or an Epic. The density rule itself still holds for every figure.

## 2026-10-08

### Changed

- The skill is now called Anatomy: `name: anatomy` in `SKILL.md`, invoked as `/anatomy`. It was developed privately as `isometric-objects` before this date, without releases.
- The CSS tokens are now `--anatomy-*` (for example `--anatomy-card`, `--anatomy-face`, `--anatomy-shade-0`); they were `--iso-*`. Every example is rebuilt with the new names.
- The figure card (`.iso-plate`) is square and flat: no rounded corners and no floating shadow, just a 1 px rule in the drawing's mid tone.
- `SKILL.md` makes high detail a standing rule for every figure, raises the parts list to at least 40 parts (60–150 for a hero figure), and adds a 4× detail pass to the final check.

### Added

- The public repository: a README with screenshots of the examples, the MIT license, a contributing guide, a code of conduct, a security policy, issue forms, a pull request template, and a CI workflow that rebuilds every example and fails if a committed page changes.
- What the skill contains at this point: the workflow and craft rules in `SKILL.md`; the kit (SVG core, round parts, pipes, the geometry audit, the WebGL layer, React components, and the 3D mode in beta); eight references; the headless Chrome checks in `scripts/`; six examples (`dial-indicator`, `desk-computer`, `raptor-engine`, `ripple-tank`, `test-rig`, `turning-dial`); and five evals.
